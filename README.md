## Overview

MatchMate is an iOS app built as part of a coding assignment.
It demonstrates modern SwiftUI architecture, offline persistence with Core Data, and network data fetching with pagination using the https://randomuser.me/api/
 API.

The app displays a list of user profiles and allows the user to accept or decline each match. User actions are stored persistently so decisions remain intact across app launches.

## 🔹 Core Functionality

- **User List with Pagination**
  - Profiles fetched from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API.
  - Supports infinite scroll pagination.
  - Continues from last saved page when reopening the app.

- **Offline Persistence**
  - Profiles are cached in Core Data.
  - Decisions (accept/decline) are preserved across sessions.
  - App loads cached profiles instantly on launch.

- **Profile Image Caching**
  - Profile images are loaded and cached using **Kingfisher**.
  - Cached images improve scrolling performance.
  - Images remain available offline once loaded.

- **Accept / Decline Actions**
  - Users can accept ✅ or decline ❌ a profile.
  - Once a decision is made, buttons are hidden and replaced by a status badge:
    - 🟢 **Accepted**
    - 🔴 **Declined**

- **Reset**
  - Reset clears all stored profiles and reloads fresh data.



## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI** for UI
- **Combine** for reactive data binding
- **Core Data** for persistence
- **MVVM** architecture
- **Kingfisher** for image loading & caching
- **Pagination handling** for API data
- **Offline sync service** (queue actions if no internet)
